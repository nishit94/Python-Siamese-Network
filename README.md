# Python-Siamese-Network

Implemented a deep neural network to predict whether two given images belong to the same class or not. This project is developed for the manta ray recognition system.
Artificial data allows to experiment with a large number of patterns and compare different network architecture.
Siamese convolution neural networks have been used to identify the pattern. Used Keras library to implement the CNN network.
